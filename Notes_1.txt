AI----> Modern and Traditional 

Modern Intelligence -----------> Narrow AI (performs only 1 task), 
                                 General AI (performs many tasks), 
                                 Super AI (numerous abilities

INDEPENDENT DOMAINS OF AI
*most dominant domain - ML

ML- Learn from experience
CV- AI cameras
Speech Processing- Siri, Cortana
NLP- chatgpt
Robotics-physical appearance of AI

Deep Neural Networks like human brain and nervous system
DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUE

AI systems that are not ML based-----face detection systems    

DATA SCIENCE IMPORTANCE:
*facebook ad
*landing page
*amazon listing

Ears of my phone is active all the time.....google voice assistant etc...

DATA 
*New oil
*find solutions to problems
*make informed decisions

REALITY ABOUT DATA:
Drowning the DATA
Starving for insights

DATA SCIENCE PIPELINE:
Data Engineering
Data Analytics
Data Visualising and Storytelling
Making data compatible for analytics----------> clean data
Clean Data ----------Analysis (EDA)


ANALYTICS:
descriptive- what happened with (30% loss in business,60% customers churned out )
diagnosis- why did this happen (reason behind the loss)
predictive-what might happen in the future ( most valuable analysis)
prescriptive- recommendations

DATA SCIENCE AND AI is complementary.
Learning is any process by which a system improves performance with experience.

MACHINE LEARNING: 
Have a clear relationship with input and output
Deal problems with incertainty
